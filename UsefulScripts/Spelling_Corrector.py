             one of the longest posts I will ever make, and one of the most real \
             too. Everyone will go through some hard times at some point. Life \
             isn''t easy. Just something to think about. Did you know the people \
             that are the strongest are usually the most sensitive? Did you know \
             the people who exhibit the most kindness are the first to get \
             mistreated? Did you know the ones who take care of others all the time \
             are usually the ones who need it the most? Did you know the three \
             hardest things to say are I love you, I''m sorry, and help me? \
             Sometimes just because a person looks happy, you have to look past \
             their smile to see how much pain they may be in. To all my friends \
             who are going through some issues right now--let''s start an intentional\
             avalanche. We all need positive intentions right now. If I don''t see \
             your name, I''ll understand. May I ask my friends wherever you might \
             be, to kindly copy and paste this status for one hour to give a moment \
             of support to all of those who have family problems, health struggles, \
             job issues, worries of any kind and just needs to know that someone cares. \
             Do it for all of us, for nobody is immune. I hope to see this on the walls \
             of all my friends just for moral support. I know some will!!! I did \
             it for a friend and you can too. You have to copy and paste this one, \
             NO SHARING... I will leave it in the comments so it is easier \
             for you to copy.'
