Observation:

- Class Imbalance
    There is a significant imbalance in the binary classes. Current the algorithm 
    is using Random slicing to breakout the validation and training sets, the 
    inbalance is approximately 88-12. 
    From inspection of the results the NN is only learning one class!!
- Optimisation
- Cross Validation
